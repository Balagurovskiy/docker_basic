# From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s package manager
# everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
# course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
# container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
# to be run directly in the container.

# run Debian (or pull if it doest exist) and bash
# --rm Automatically remove the container when it exits (docker run --help)
# -i Interactive mode (Keep STDIN open even if not attached)
# -t Allocate a pseudo-TTY

# -y Automatic yes to prompts.
