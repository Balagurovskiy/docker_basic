# Launch a shell from an alpine container, and make sure that you can interact
# directly with the container via your terminal, and that the container deletes itself
# once the shellâ€™s execution is done.


# Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox.

# /bin/ash is Ash (Almquist Shell) provided by BusyBox
# --rm Automatically remove the container when it exits (docker run --help)
# -i Interactive mode (Keep STDIN open even if not attached)
# -t Allocate a pseudo-TTY
