# Launch a phpmyadmin container as a background task. It should be named roach-warden,
# its 80 port should be bound to the 8081 port of the virtual machine and it should
# be able to explore the database stored in the spawning-pool container.

# You can add your own custom config.inc.php settings (such as Configuration Storage setup)
# by creating a file named "config.user.inc.php" with the various user defined settings
# in it, and then linking it into the container using:
# docker run --name myadmin -d --link mysql_db_server:db -p 8080:80 -v /some/local/directory/config.user.inc.php:/etc/phpmyadmin/config.user.inc.php phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin

# -d 	Run container in background and print container ID
# -p 	Publish a container's port(s) to the host
# --link 	Add link to another container

#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#

docker run -d --name roach-warden -p 8081:80 --link spawning-pool:db phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
