# Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its
# own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan.
# You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that
# the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and that the container
# itself is named spawning-pool.

#   -d, Run container in background and print container ID
#   -v, Bind mount a volume
#   -e, Set environment variables

# docker images - Check images
# docker ps - Check spawning-pool in proc list
# docker inspect spawning-pool

#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#
